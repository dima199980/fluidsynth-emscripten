# FluidSynth with Emscripten-specific patch

This repository is based on [FluidSynth](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth) repository, and contains some changes to build with Emscripten.

The original README is here: [README.original.md](./README.original.md)

## Build (enikey87)

Prerequisites (Debian/Ubuntu): `git python3 wget xz-utils cmake make pkg-config autoconf automake libtool`.

```shell
./build_libsndfile.sh   # libsndfile + ogg/vorbis/flac/opus into ../libsndfile-emscripten; build.sh needs it for the sf3 variants
./build.sh              # every libfluidsynth-X.X.X*.js / .wasm variant into ./dist
```

Both scripts source `emsdk-env.sh`, which installs Emscripten `3.1.10` (override with `EMSDK_VERSION`) into `../emsdk` unless `emcmake` is already on `PATH`. An `emcmake` you provide yourself must run with node < 18: 3.1.10 output calls the global `fetch` node 18+ ships, and autoconf's run test fails with `cannot run C compiled programs`.

## Build with Docker (enikey87)

A single command builds every variant into `./dist`:

```shell
docker compose run --rm --build --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" builder
```

`--user` keeps the artifacts owned by you rather than by root. The image carries a
prebuilt libsndfile (needed for sf3), so a rebuild only recompiles fluidsynth.

## Build (from jet2jet)

> Tested with Emscripten version 3.1.10.

1. (Optional) Update `emscripten/exports.txt`, containing export functions for JS program
    * The script `emscripten/make-exports.js` will update this automatically, gathering functions from `include` directory.
2. Make sure that Emscripten is usable on the current environment
3. Make `build` directory
4. Enter `build` directory and execute `emcmake cmake -Denable-oss=off -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..`
    * If no other options are specified, and `cmake` is running with `emcmake` (or `emconfigure`), the build configurations are initialized for Emscripten-build mode.
5. In `build` directory, execute `emmake make`

After successful build, `libfluidsynth-<version>.js` will be created at `build/src` directory.

* If `enable-debug` specified on the `cmake` execution (e.g. `emcmake cmake -Denable-debug=on ..`), a map file `libfluidsynth-<version>.wasm.map` is also generated.
    * Currently it seems that it cannot be used.
* If `enable-separate-wasm` specified on the `cmake` execution (e.g. `emcmake cmake -Denable-separate-wasm=on ..`), `libfluidsynth-<version>.wasm` and `libfluidsynth-<version>.wast` are also generated.
    * For AudioWorklet, you cannot use `*.wasm` file directly.
* In Emscripten-build mode, standalone application named `fluidsynth` is not emitted.

## Build static library for Emscripten

Please specify `-D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=off` on calling emcmake. (e.g. `emcmake cmake -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=off ..`)

In this mode, you can also build sources under `doc` directory (e.g. `cd build/doc && make fluidsynth_simple -j16`), although all exportable functions will be exported.

## Usage

Place `libfluidsynth-<version>.js` file to your space and load `libfluidsynth-<version>.js`. After load, almost all FluidSynth API functions are accessible via `Module` object (note that all function names have the prefix `_`).

To use `libfluidsynth-<version>.js` in AudioWorklet, load it into AudioWorklet before your worklet JS file. In your worklet JS file, you can access `Module` object via `AudioWorkletGlobalScope.wasmModule`.

## Miscellaneous

* Currently only several APIs are tested. Some APIs such as for drivers may not work.
